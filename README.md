### Project specific

Tool to get hex colors with regex, edit it by shifting HSL and insert it back.
I used it to create my own [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) themes [Diry-orange](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/Dirty-orange-blender-theme) [Dark-violet](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/Dark-violet-blender-theme). Don't get me wrong, most likely u won't be able to build perfect theme with just this tool, but imho it's good as a starting point.
